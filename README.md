<h3>
  Here is my first attempt at crafting a 2D pixel art game, the video is sped up 2x to shwo the purpose of the game. It's all about a polar bear on a mission to collect hearts while avoiding a few traps. Polaris Run, represents my initiation into the realm of game development. Throughout the process, I acquired newfound skills in level design, player movement implementation, and even the artistry involved in creating the polar bear character and the heart collectibles. These visuals were painstakingly drawn frame by frame, thanks to the pixel art tool, Piskel. 
  <br />
  <br />
  Additionally, I incorporated existing graphics for the game's terrain and traps from Unity's Asset Store. The game also features dynamic elements, such as moving platforms and cleverly designed traps, along with menus for starting and concluding the game. This was a delightful, compact project that allowed my creative flair to shine through, making the development process thoroughly enjoyable.
